<h1>World population Analysis </h1>


<h1>Description</h1>
This is an analysis of world population growth rates by cities for the year 2023/2024. It uses various data manipulation and visualization techniques to provide insights into population distribution and growth patterns across different continents and countries.

<h1>Steps and Insights<h1>
Data Loading and Initial Exploration

The dataset is loaded using pd.read_csv.
Initial checks such as shape, info, and descriptive statistics are performed.
Missing values are identified and investigated.


<h2> Data Cleaning <h2>


Missing continent information is filled using the REST Countries API to fetch country and continent data.
The dataset is merged with the fetched data to fill in missing continent information.
Remaining missing values are manually filled (e.g., Czech Republic is filled as 'Europe').
The dataframe is restored to its original shape with necessary columns.
Missing Values Check

After cleaning, the dataset is checked again for any remaining missing values.

<h2>Assumptions and Conclusions from the Data<h2>



** High Growth Rate Countries **

Urbanization:
Countries with the highest growth rates likely have significant urbanization. Rapid migration from rural to urban areas for better job opportunities and living conditions can drive this growth.

Economic Opportunities:
High growth rates may indicate strong economic opportunities, attracting both local and international migration.

High Fertility Rates:
Regions with higher fertility rates, such as parts of Africa and Asia, contribute significantly to population growth. Cultural factors and access to healthcare can influence birth rates.

Favorable Policies:
Government policies that promote family growth, immigration, and urban development might contribute to high population growth rates.

** Low Growth Rate Countries **

Aging Population:
Countries with low growth rates might be experiencing an aging population, with higher death rates and lower birth rates.

Emigration:
High levels of emigration due to economic challenges, political instability, or better opportunities abroad can lead to low growth rates.

Economic Stagnation:
Economic difficulties and lack of job opportunities might deter population growth.

Low Fertility Rates:
Regions with lower fertility rates, such as parts of Europe and North America, contribute to slower population growth. Factors include higher living costs, career priorities, and access to family planning.
